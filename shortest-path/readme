If you don't want to use the i18N_T package, you'll have to replace all the calls to i18N_T() by gettext(), intl fonctions, or by sentences in your own language.

This class is reasonably fast as once it has found solutions, they are recorded in the "chemins" table.
You can, of course, rename the database, the tables and the fields to fit your habits.
Once you are decided, you'll have to change the default values in constantes.php

This class takes three parameters as input :
the  start point
the end point
the way the calculation is effectued (distance or time).
It returns a graph object containing the collection of results (in collectionOK).

Temporary branches are kept in list objets with the "liste" class (class.liste.php).

This class tries to get rid of bad branches very quick to make the search faster.

One important point : when adding records in th "vvd" table, always add the two directions (eg : A -> B and B-> A).
The class knows which one it must use in a branche so that it doesn't loop.

The "graph" class (class.graph.php) could be adapted for many other uses.
